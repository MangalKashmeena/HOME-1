				<h3> Songs</h3>
				<p> Do you ever hear a Disney song by your favourite artist? Sometimes, musicians love the original so much that they decide to change it up with thier own style. For example, Demi Lovato released her own
version of "Let it Go". When Moana came out, Alessia Cara modernized the song, "How Far I'll Go" to suit her. Many have also created Disney inspired songs. Ruth B's "Lost Boy" 
outlined Peter Pan so perfectly. Zendaya also wrote and preformed "Neverland" based on Peter Pan. It's great to hear so many Disney inspired songs!
